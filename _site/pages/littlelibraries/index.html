            Have you ever scored a great book at a little library? I 
            once did. Deep into a months-long wait for <em>Crying in H-Mart</em> 
            at the public library, I came across a copy at my 
            neighborhood little library. My find wasn’t entirely 
            perfect—the text was in large print—but it was better 
            than waiting another two months. More often though, when 
            I peek into a little library, I’m amazed by how bizarre 
            the collection seems. Dated parenting guides, splashy crime 
            thrillers, and fantastical YA novels abound, not to mention 
            an ever present (but unwanted) copy of <em>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</em>. 
            I always find myself wondering, <em>what kind of selection is this, exactly?</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            So when I heard about a library cataloguing app 
            from my friend Emilia, I got an idea. Perhaps, 
            by using this app, I could take a more rigorous 
            and unified look at the collection of books held 
            in Somerville little libraries. After consulting 
            a map of local little libraries, I hit the streets. 
            At each little library, I scanned all the books 
            into the <a href="https://www.libib.com/" target="_blank">Libib</a> app using their barcodes, if present. 
            Once scanned, I was able to get the ISBN of each book, 
            which I then used to query the Google Books and Open 
            Library APIs to create a complete dataset with details 
            on each book's publishing date, length, genre, and more.
        </p>

            <img
                src="images/spring_hill_terrace.jpeg">
            <figcaption>This little library on Spring Hill Terrace was worth a visit for its yard decorations alone</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Right away, I noticed a big difference in how well-stocked 
            each library was. Out of the 17 libraries I visited, 
            I found the largest assortment of titles in a sturdy 
            green library on Willoughby St, which held an impressive 
            21 books. Some, like a slogan-covered library on 
            Norfolk St with a sparse collection of 3 books, 
            were disappointing in their size. Most, however, 
            offered a decent browsing selection. With the median little 
            library holding about 10 books, I found most libraries 
            worthy of a brief look.

    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            What did these collections contain? I wasn’t sure 
            if there were actually that many parenting guides, 
            or if I was just projecting my insecurities around 
            close friends beginning to start families. Turns 
            out, my perception wasn’t entirely unfounded as the 
            Family & Relationships category came in as the seventh 
            most common genre. While fiction was overwhelmingly 
            the most prevalent category, I was surprised to see how 
            popular the Juvenile and Young Adult genres were, 
            which, when combined together, accounted for 32 books. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I guessed that the number of Juvenile and YA books 
            was perhaps due to some of the little libraries’ 
            proximity to the local high school, but when I 
            looked into the data, the four libraries near the 
            high school only accounted for seven Juvenile and YA books. 
            Turns out, the prevalence of this genre is widespread 
            across Somerville and Cambridge.

            When were most books published? I expected the collection 
            in little libraries to trend older, since I assumed 
            donors would be more willing to part with books they’ve 
            had for a few years. Upon inspection, the most common 
            publishing decade for books was 2010, with the vast 
            majority of books being published from 1990 onwards. 
            The lack of barcodes on older books likely contributed to 
            this recency bias. <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/retailing/article/73660-digital-publishing-s-bar-code-revolution.html" target="_blank">Barcodes weren’t adopted by publishers 
            until the mid-80s</a>, and even then, they faced resistance 
            from designers, who thought the codes marred their 
            compositions, and idealistic publishers, who thought 
            barcodes’ commercial association corrupted books’ purity. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Being published before widespread adoption wasn’t the 
            only reason books lacked barcodes. Some paperbacks were 
            simply too faded, while hardcover books in little libraries 
            were often missing their jackets (and therefore their 
            barcodes too). At an eclectically decorated little 
            library (and yard) on Spring Hill Terrace, I came 
            across several newly-published books which lacked 
            barcodes. On further inspection, these books were all 
            advance reader copies, likely donated by a bookseller, 
            reviewer, or librarian.

            The longest book I catalogued was <em>The Bedford Handbook</em>, an 
            849-page tome about the mechanics of the English language. 
            At the other end of the scale were two alliterative children’s 
            books—<em>Sammy Spider's First Mitzvah</em> and <em>Sunny the Sneaker</em>—each 
            just 24 pages long. The most common length was right around 300 pages.

            During my 17 little library visits, I did manage to find a book I wanted to 
            read: <em>A Room with a View by E.M. Forster</em>—a classic I’ve had on my list 
            for a few years now. Unfortunately, it was too tattered to have a 
            readable barcode, so, like twenty or so other books I came across, it wasn’t 
            included in my dataset.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course, I felt compelled to leave a book in turn. If you’d like 
            a copy of <em>Either/Or</em> by Elif Batuman, you can find it at the Norfolk St 
            little library—I thought it was best to prop up the smallest collection. 
            Alternatively, you can peruse <a href="https://www.libib.com/u/somervillelittilelib" target="_blank"> the full collection I catalogued</a> 
            and see if there's anything that catches your interest. Happy browsing!
