        <p>Here is a nice poem that Eliza shared with me. It is by Reverand Max Coots.
        </p>
        <p class="poem">
            Let us give thanks for a bounty of people:<br><br>
            For children who are our second planting, and though they grow like weeds and the wind
            too soon blows them away, may they forgive us our cultivation and fondly remember
            where their roots are;<br><br>
            For generous friends with hearts and smiles as bright as their blossoms;<br><br>
            For feisty friends as tart as apples;<br><br>
            For continuous friends, who, like scallions and cucumbers, keep reminding us that we've
            had them;<br><br>
            For crotchety friends, as sour as rhubarb and as indestructible;<br><br>
            For handsome friends, who are as gorgeous as eggplants and as elegant as a row of corn,
            and the other, plain as potatoes and as good for you;<br><br>
            For funny friends, who are as silly as Brussels Sprouts and as amusing as Jerusalem
            Artichokes, and serious friends, as complex as cauliflowers and as intricate as onions;
            For friends as unpretentious as cabbages, as subtle as summer squash, as persistent as
            parsley, as delightful as dill, as endless as zucchini, and who, like parsnips, can be
            counted on to see you through the winter;<br><br>
            For old friends, nodding like sunflowers in the evening-time, and young friends coming
            on as fast as radishes;<br><br>
            For loving friends, who wind around us like tendrils and hold us, despite our blights,
            wilts and witherings;<br><br>
            And finally, for those friends now gone, like gardens past that have been harvested, and
            who fed us in their times that we might have life thereafter;<br><br>
            For all these we give thanks.

                    Now that streaming has turned into cable television, we can return to the wonderful world of free films on youtube.<br><br>
                    This month's free youtube film comes from director Matt Wolf and centers on the story of Arthur Russell, a talented avant-garde cellist and disco producer, who died from AIDS-related illnesses in 1992. A series of post-humous releases led to a resurgence of interest in his work.
                    <br><br>
                    The highlights of the film are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Russell’s midwestern parents (who remind me of my grandparents)</li>
                        <li>It’s depiction of NYC in the 70s and 80s (Russell was a close friend of Allen Ginsberg)</li>
                        <li>Tom Lee’s efforts to share Russell’s music</li>
                </p>
