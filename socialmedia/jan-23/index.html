                <p>Hello. Thanks for tuning in to my social media for the month of January. January was an exciting month! I drove across the country with my mom and moved to Durango, CO. Some highlights include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The beautiful highways of Connecticut</li>
                        <li>The beautiful highways of Pennsylvania</li>
                        <li>The bumpy highways of Indiana</li>
                        <li>The delightful corporate sameness of Starbucks</li>
                        <li>Having dinner with my mom's college friends "Dog" and "Radar" in Kansas City and hearing about Dallas in the 80s</li>
                        <li>The beautiful two lane 65mph roads of western Kansas and eastern Colorado</li>
                        <li>Dry cold</li>
                        <li>Ample sunshine</li>
                        <li>Ample snow</li>
                        <li>The Durango public library</li>
                        <li>Volunteering with adaptive sports at purgatory</li>
                        <li>The very pleasant bike path along the Animas river</li>
                        <li>My very soothing intro to pottery class</li>
                    </ul>
                    Here are some more things I want to share. Don't forget to share things with me for next month. I hope you</p>

        <p class="bw-bg">Here is a poem that Eliza shared with me. It is by Reverand Max Coots.
        </p>
        <p class="bw-bg poem">
            Let us give thanks for a bounty of people:<br><br>
            For children who are our second planting, and though they grow like weeds and the wind
            too soon blows them away, may they forgive us our cultivation and fondly remember
            where their roots are;<br><br>
            For generous friends with hearts and smiles as bright as their blossoms;<br><br>
            For feisty friends as tart as apples;<br><br>
            For continuous friends, who, like scallions and cucumbers, keep reminding us that we've
            had them;<br><br>
            For crotchety friends, as sour as rhubarb and as indestructible;<br><br>
            For handsome friends, who are as gorgeous as eggplants and as elegant as a row of corn,
            and the other, plain as potatoes and as good for you;<br><br>
            For funny friends, who are as silly as Brussels Sprouts and as amusing as Jerusalem
            Artichokes, and serious friends, as complex as cauliflowers and as intricate as onions;
            For friends as unpretentious as cabbages, as subtle as summer squash, as persistent as
            parsley, as delightful as dill, as endless as zucchini, and who, like parsnips, can be
            counted on to see you through the winter;<br><br>
            For old friends, nodding like sunflowers in the evening-time, and young friends coming
            on as fast as radishes;<br><br>
            For loving friends, who wind around us like tendrils and hold us, despite our blights,
            wilts and witherings;<br><br>
            And finally, for those friends now gone, like gardens past that have been harvested, and
            who fed us in their times that we might have life thereafter;<br><br>
            For all these we give thanks.

                    Sadly, my initial selection for youtube film of the month is no longer available due to a copyright claim (such is the nature of things in the wonderful world of youtube films). Luckily, there are many excellent youtube films to choose from.
                    <br><br>
                    This month's free youtube film (first released in 2003) comes from Jamie Johnson, heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, and explores the experience of growing up with extreme wealth through a series of interviews with soon-to-be millionaires and billionaires. The interviews are grotesquely entertaining and surprisingly humanizing. Some of of the interviewees are pompous and instantly dislikable, while others grow on you over the course of the film. The highlight of the film is the interview with teenage Ivanka Trump. Enjoy!

        <h2>NEW ENGLAND TOWNS, RANKED</h2>
        <p>There are few things in life I love more than quaint New England towns (only my family and Strava come to mind). Thankfully, I’ve had the unique pleasure of living in and visiting many wonderful New England towns.</p>
        <p>Now, I would like to share my definitive ranking. To be eligible, a town must be in New England, have a population of more than 1,000 and less than 25,000 people, and have a downtown with more than five stores. I also must have visited the town in person.</p>
        <p>When creating this ranking, I considered my personal connection to the town as well as the town’s location, architecture, layout, vibe, and proximity to natural amenities.</p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <img src="https://www.rangeleyrentals.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Rangeley-sunset-cropped-2-2.jpeg">
        <p><strong>1) Rangeley, ME</strong></p>
        <p><em>Amount of time I’ve spent there:</em> Lots!</p>
        <p><em>Why:</em> Rangeley has lakes, mountains, and a charming downtown. No other New England town has all three things! Rangeley also scores extremely well on my sentimentality scale since we vacationed there as a family throughout my childhood.</p>
        <p><em>Niche.com review:</em> "Rangeley is a really small town in Maine with about 1,100 people year round. We are a very big tourist town and thats where the town makes most of its money. Most people grew up and haven't left Rangeley so there is a bunch of gossip from adults in the town still having issues with one another that developed in high school."</p>
        <p><em>Best bet:</em> Browse the local bookstore (Books, Lines, and Thinkers) then stop by Pine Tree Frosty for ice cream.</p>
        <img src="https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/3111924/1200x630/flatten;crop_down;webp=auto;jpeg_quality=70">
        <p><strong>2) Montpelier, VT</strong></p>
        <p><em>Amount of time I’ve spent there:</em> Approximately 4 hours</p>
        <p><em>Why:</em> While most towns featured in this ranking are pretty unexciting beyond their access to the outdoors, Montpelier (from my very brief trip there) seems to balance outdoor access and “culture” fairly well. It is 30 mins from the Green Mountains, 1hr 20 mins from Franconia Notch, and has nice trail system (Hubbard Park) in town. At the same time, because it is the capitol of Vermont, Montpelier has a more lively and developed downtown than most towns of its size (by lively and developed, I mean that it has an arthouse cinema).</p>
        <p><em>Niche.com review:</em> "A small Vermont community that definitely stretches the definition of city. Having lived here since I was six, there are definitely worse places to live. This 'city' is picturesque, fairly liberal, and offers that 'quaint Vermont charm' to tourists. However, it isn't nearly as liberal as it thinks it is, and offers very little to residents. In fact, it is so unbearably dull that almost everyone under the age of 35 here is desperate to leave. Really, the most appealing thing about it is the fact that we're the only state capitol that does not have a McDonalds."</p>
        <p><em>Best bet:</em> Watch <i>The Worst Person in the World</i> at the Savoy Theater</p>
        <img src="https://www.ncic.org/wp-content/uploads/TownManagerNCIC.jpg">
        <p><strong>3) Littleton/Bethlehem, NH</strong></p>
        <p><em>Amount of time I’ve spent there:</em> Lots!</p>
        <p><em>Why:</em> Bethlehem and Littleton are a great compromise between proximity to the best peaks in New England (Franconia ridge and the Presidential range) and downtown quality. From my view, the outdoor access in these towns is as good as the outdoor access in North Conway, but their downtowns are more authentic. The cause of this phenomenon is Lincoln, NH, which sacrificed all of its town character so that Littleton and Bethlehem’s could be preserved. </p>
        <p><em>Niche.com review:</em> "The town is trying to grow, but its people are mostly stuck in their old ways. The amounts of construction that never seems to end is ridiculous. Also, the poorly planned pick-up and drop-off at the elementary school makes every day a hassle twice a day. Add in construction right before the school and you have easily a half hour wait, just to pick up your children."</p>
        <p><em>Best bet:</em> Super Secret Ice Cream</p>
        <img src="https://www.bostonmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/what-to-do-in-northampton.jpg">
        <p><strong>4) Northampton, MA</strong></p>
        <p><em>Amount of time I’ve spent there:</em> Four days</p>
        <p><em>Why: </em>Northampton is an enlightened progressive utopia</p>
        <p><em>Niche.com review: </em>"It's sort of a tourist town in the summer and total elitist garbage when the local college are in session. People generally don't understand simple concepts like cross walks, Please and thank you, or general politeness. Everything is expensive."</p>
        <p><em>Best bet: </em>Spend the day with Emilia and Meredith and meet their cat Opabinia</p>
        <img src="https://www.hickokandboardman.com/moving-to-vermont/wp-content/uploads/slider/cache/55e47541a7c3028f8213ebdcf6006b6f/Richmond.jpg">
        <p><strong>5) Richmond, VT</strong></p>
        <p><em>Amount of time I’ve spent there:</em> A couple visits</p>
        <p><em>Why: </em>Small town feel with nearby outdoor access (Camel’s Hump, Sleepy Hollow, Bolton Valley) and you can be in Burlington in 15 minutes. There’s also a church in Richmond that is round. It is pretty neat — you should check it out.</p>
        <p><em>Niche.com review: </em>"Typical small town! Great environment for families and those who love nature as that is one of the biggest draws."</p>
        <p><em>Best bet: </em>Hike Camel’s Hump from the north</p>
        <img src="https://mainstreetmaine.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Rockland-Dave-Clough-Photography-36.jpeg">
        <p><strong>6) Rockland, ME</strong></p>
        <p><em>Amount of time I’ve spent there:</em> Half a day</p>
        <p><em>Why:</em> Rockland is home to two good art museums: the Farnsworth Art Museum and the Center for Maine Contemporary Art. Plus, its got all the typical Maine things (e.g., cute downtown, is by the ocean, etc.).</p>
        <p><em>Niche.com review: </em>"Rockland is okay. It's pretty all year and not a terrible place to live. However, there's a reasonable amount of crime and mistakes made in town."</p>
        <p><em>Best bet:</em> Visit the Wyeth Center to view paintings by three generations of artists (N.C. Wyeth, Andrew Wyeth, and James Wyeth)</p>
        <img src="https://growthzonesitesprod.azureedge.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2812/2021/10/Dirk-MacKnights-fall-aerial-mountains-and-river-w1900.jpeg">
        <p><strong>7) Bethel, ME</strong></p>
        <p><em>Amount of time I’ve spent there:</em> Several days</p>
        <p><em>Why:</em> Real town with access to both the Mahoosucs and the White Mountains. Bethel is a ski town (Sunday River is nearby), but still retains a classic New England village feel. Bethel has a high sentimentality score because it was a favorite destination of the crew when I worked at Cold River Camp in Evans Notch.</p>
        <p><em>Niche.com review: </em>"Beautiful area, nothing to do, primarily retirees, no nightlife or culture. Schools are mediocre as well."</p>
        <p><em>Best bet:</em> RIP Cafe DICOCOA. Tube the Androscoggin and go to the Sugar Shack.</p>
        <img src="https://newengland.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_1307131492.jpg">
        <p><strong>8) Kittery, ME</strong></p>
        <p><em>Amount of time I’ve spent there:</em> More than most</p>
        <p><em>Why:</em> Kittery has a bunch of obnoxious outlets, but downtown Kittery (Kittery Point) is an anomaly. Whereas in most small towns the majority of businesses are mediocre with a couple of standouts, most of the businesses in Kittery Point are great.</p>
        <p><em>Niche.com review: </em>"I love Kittery for its close-knit community, historical landmarks, and beautiful scenes of the east coast. I would like to see a better school system, a reduced rate of development, and more lenient leash rules for dogs."</p>
        <p><em>Best bet:</em> Walk around Fort Foster, eat at Anju Noodle Bar</p>
        <img src="https://www.travellens.co/content/images/2022/10/portsmouth-new-hampshire.jpeg">
        <p><strong>9) Portsmouth, NH</strong></p>
        <p><em>Amount of time I’ve spent there:</em> More than most</p>
        <p><em>Why:</em> Portsmouth used to be cooler, but now most of the young people have been priced out to Dover. Nevertheless, Portsmouth is still residually cool from when it was cooler (some call it the Williamsburg of New Hampshire).</p>
        <p><em>Niche.com review: </em>"Portsmouth is a beautiful city to visit and bring the family. It is not a resident conscious city. It does not spend its time trying to make a better living environment but rather looks more toward getting money through tourism and tickets. Activities that locals have loved for years have been threatend due to this mentality. When we first moved here everyone at the local coffee shop or parks new each other. Now it is overrun with tourists and it doesn’t feel as much like home. The town treats hotels better than residents. It is like pulling teeth trying to keep certain residential areas from becoming huge parking lots. The Portsmouth circle is hardly monitored and several rodes I actually avoid due to unsafe driving."</p>
        <p><em>Best bet:</em> Visit the Isle of Shoales, eat at Green Elephant</p>
        <img src="https://damariscottaregion.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/downtown-sample-image.jpg">
        <p><strong>10) Damariscotta, ME</strong></p>
        <p><em>Amount of time I’ve spent there:</em> 3 hours</p>
        <p><em>Why:</em> Oysters, quintessential midcoast Maine town</p>
        <p><em>Niche.com review: </em>"All the people are the same"</p>
        <p><em>Best bet:</em> Damariscotta fish ladder, Shuck Station, Skidompha Secondhand Bookstore</p>
        <img src="https://www.visitingnewengland.com/PageMill_Resources/newburyport-state-street-2021">
        <p><strong>11) Newburyport, MA</strong></p>
        <p><em>Amount of time I’ve spent there:</em> Lots!</p>
        <p><em>Why:</em> My hometown. If Portsmouth is the edgy younger sister who is now settling down and having kids, Newburyport is her congenial, slightly-corporate older brother.</p>
        <p><em>Niche.com review:</em> "It's New England, the weather changes daily."</p>
        <p><em>Best bet:</em> Film at the Screening Room (a great single room independent cinema), peruse Jabberwocky bookstore</p>
        <img src="https://images.fineartamerica.com/images/artworkimages/mediumlarge/1/autumn-in-danville-vermont-sherman-perry.jpg">
        <p><strong>12) Danville, VT</strong></p>
        <p><em>Amount of time I’ve spent there:</em> Driven through</p>
        <p><em>Why:</em> Danville is up on a hill and the view of the Whites on a clear day is excellent.</p>
        <p><em>Niche.com review:</em> "Outwardly a picturesque, quaint Vermont town - closer inspection from living here reveals majorly short sighted and ill informed decisions made by ALL local government and an absolute air of racism and elitism. I might have just described all of the NEK?

There are pockets of wonderful people and many residents are community minded though the abuse from "old time Vermonters" makes calling this your "home" impossible.

Allergic to any form of change - Vermont is the most faux-progressive place I've ever lived. Look elsewhere."</p>
        <p><em>Best bet:</em> I once bought an egg sandwich at Marty’s 1st Stop in Danville. I think it was fine. Apparently, there is a large corn maize there too.</p>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Court_Square%2C_Greenfield_MA.jpg">
        <p><strong>13) Greenfield, MA</strong></p>
        <p><em>Amount of time I’ve spent there:</em> 2 hours</p>
        <p><em>Why:</em> I went to a zine club in Greenfield and enjoyed myself. Northampton is too expensive so everyone lives here instead.</p>
        <p><em>Niche.com review:</em> "Overall it is a pretty good town. It has an up and coming arts scene and it has decent places to eat food. The community is good and mostly friendly. There are draw backs like the heroin problem and std cases. There are risks and concerns about the town but overall the people are good."</p>
        <p><em>Best bet:</em> Go to the zine club</p>
        <img src="https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/3782387-scaled.jpeg">
        <p><strong>14) North Conway, NH</strong></p>
        <p><em>Amount of time I’ve spent there:</em> Lots!</p>
        <p><em>Why:</em> Very touristy, but not without charm. North Conway is the epicenter of the White Mountain region.</p>

        <p><em>Best bet:</em> Hike Kearsarge North or the Moats, then head to Old Village Bakery or Trails End Ice Cream in Intervale</p>

        <p><strong>15) Waterbury, VT</strong></p>
        <p><em>Amount of time I’ve spent there:</em> 15 minutes</p>
        <p><em>Why:</em> Jake and I tried to go to an ice cream cart in Waterbury, but it was sadly closed. Nevertheless, in our brief walk along the sidewalks, I found Waterbury to be charming and ideally located with Stowe to the north, Waitsfield to the south, Burlington to the west, and Montpelier to the east.</p>
        <p><em>Niche.com review:</em> "Waterbury VT is a small tight knit community that cares deeply about our neighboors. It is not your typical small town with the successful and growing Alchemist brewery, bars and delicious restaurants it is a fun little town with a surprising night life. There are many hotels for people visiting and it makes a great place to live while still being attached to the rest of state with easy access to the highway, ski slopes it is like one of the hubs of Vermont. One thing that does need improvement and you find in any small town is how much people talk. Absolutely anything you do will be seen and passed through the grapevine because everyone knows each other. The beautiful part is though that that is true for in town but not for right outside of the town. You can go from pavement to beautiful dirt roads and farms quickly."</p>
        <p><em>Best bet:</em> Go to the ice cream cart when it is actually open</p>
        <img src="https://www.heartofvt.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Hardwick2.jpg">
        <p><strong>16) Hardwick, VT</strong></p>
        <p><em>Amount of time I’ve spent there:</em> 2 minutes 30 seconds</p>
        <p><em>Why:</em> I was riding the high of driving through Vermont on a summer evening (lush, rolling farmland, no billboards yay) when I passed through downtown Hardwick. It had a nice hipneck vibe. Plus, one of my favorite podcasts, <a href="https://rumblestripvermont.com/episodes/">Rumble Strip</a>, is made in Hardwick, so that counts for something.</p>
        <p><em>Niche.com review:</em> "Hardwick is a pleasant town, with buildings straight out of the 1800's. I would however like to see more stop lights."</p>
        <p><em>Best bet:</em> Listen to the Rumble Strip episode <a href="https://rumblestripvermont.com/2021/11/finn-and-the-bell/">Finn and the Bell</a></p>

        <p><strong>17) White River Junction, VT</strong></p>
        <p><em>Amount of time I’ve spent there:</em> Couple visits</p>
        <p><em>Why:</em> White River Junction is a former railroad depot that has reinvented itself as an artsy hub.</p>
        <p><em>Niche.com review:</em> "Not too much to do. It is quite hectic with the train being nosiy and runniung amuck. But other than that, it's good."</p>
        <p><em>Best bet:</em> Get an MFA at the Center for Cartoon Studies</p>
        <img src="https://images.fineartamerica.com/images/artworkimages/mediumlarge/2/downtown-plymouth-new-hampshire-denis-tangney-jr.jpg">
        <p><strong>18) Plymouth, NH</strong></p>
        <p><em>Amount of time I’ve spent there:</em> Several visits</p>
        <p><em>Why:</em> Plymouth is an underrated town. It doesn’t have the scenic wow factor of other towns in the White Mountain region, but it has an enjoyable downtown that is ideally situated between Franconia Notch and the Lakes region.</p>
        <p><em>Niche.com review:</em> "There is little to no public transportation, taxis don't really exist, there is no trains or segways."</p>
        <p><em>Best bet:</em> Ladders thrift store</p>
        <img src="https://cdn.branchcms.com/3OqdQyyd80-810/images/directory/profile/Downtown6.jpg">
        <p><strong>19) Farmington, ME</strong></p>
        <p><em>Amount of time I’ve spent there:</em> Several days</p>
        <p><em>Why:</em> The Reny’s in Farmington is in an old theater. It is the best Reny’s in Maine and therefore the world.</p>
        <p><em>Niche.com review:</em> "It feels like everyone knows everyone around here."</p>
        <p><em>Best bet:</em> Go to Reny’s</p>
        <img src="https://www.travellens.co/content/images/2022/01/Exeter-nh.jpg">
        <p><strong>21) Exeter, NH</strong></p>
        <p><em>Amount of time I’ve spent there:</em> Several visits</p>
        <p><em>Why:</em> Home to Phillips Exeter Academy. Exeter is an old money enclave with a historic feel.</p>
        <p><em>Niche.com review:</em> "Exeter is a very small town, but holds great historical significance, as it was once the capital of NH. This gives all the residents great pride in knowing their small town is very important to the history of our country."</p>
        <p><em>Best bet:</em> Walk around the campus and try to imagine a young Zuckerberg hustling between classes</p>
        <img src="https://downeasterpackages.com/wp-content/uploads/Untitled-1.png">
        <p><strong>22) Freeport, ME</strong></p>
        <p><em>Amount of time I’ve spent there:</em> Several visits</p>
        <p><em>Why:</em> Going to the LL Bean HQ is a peak childhood experience. I don’t know if I can ever go back lest my glorious memories of the place be destroyed.</p>
        <p><em>Niche.com review:</em> "Nice small town. Busy summers and audit the rest of the year. Lots of shopping and great deals year round. We also have a Nike outlet where you can score really good deals and items priced to be affordable."</p>
        <p><em>Best bet:</em> Wolfe’s Neck Woods State Park</p>
        <img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7454/13937207007_7170ac412f_b.jpg">
        <p><strong>23) Berlin, NH</strong></p>
        <p><em>Amount of time I’ve spent there:</em> Several visits</p>
        <p><em>Why:</em> Berlin is well known for the economic challenges it has faced since its pulp mill closed in 2007 (both the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/02/us/02berlin.html">NYT</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/were-hurting-in-new-hampshires-poorest-city-few-signs-of-trumps-blue-collar-boom/2020/02/09/7021ad6c-49ec-11ea-9475-535736e48788_story.html">WaPo</a> have written about it). It is an interesting place to visit. Berlin has several stately buildings from its industrial heyday and a rich Scandinavian and French-Canadian heritage. The contrast of the mill’s smokestacks against the backdrop of cliffy Mt. Forist is a striking image. It’s impossible to drive around Berlin and not wonder about what it used to be like and what it could be.</p>
        <p><em>Niche.com review:</em> "We live far north from much action."</p>
        <p><em>Best bet:</em> Get takeout from Chai Thai cuisine (formerly Ron’s), then visit my pulmonologist Dr. Peggy Simon at Androscoggin Valley Hospital!</p>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Downtown_Gorham_5.JPG">
        <p><strong>24) Gorham, NH</strong></p>
        <p><em>Amount of time I’ve spent there:</em> Lots!</p>
        <p><em>Why:</em> Beautiful location, but the downtown isn't a downtown.</p>
        <p><em>Niche.com review:</em> "A quaint town whose industry is almost exclusively based on tourism. During the summer the variety of restaurants and shops in this small town are great food. The natural scenery around the town is also beautiful and hiking in the white mountains is a great activity. Besides the tourism and hiking there is little to do though."</p>
        <p><em>Best bet:</em> Gas in Gorham is cheaper than elsewhere in the Whites</p>
        <img src="https://linekinbayresort.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/BBH-Gimbel.jpeg">
        <p><strong>25) Boothbay, ME</strong></p>
        <p><em>Amount of time I’ve spent there:</em> One day</p>
        <p><em>Why:</em> Boothbay's downtown is a large tourist trap</p>
        <p><em>Niche.com review:</em> "Boothbay is a beautiful, quiet town. It's relaxing, but that relaxation can become boring after a while."
        <p><em>Best bet:</em> I would skip Boothbay and go to a different coastal Maine town. Visit the Maine Coastal Botanical gardens though!</p>

                <p>I am excited to feature Kesiah as the inaugural friend of the month. I called her up to congratulate her. This interview has been heavily edited for brevity and clarity.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><strong>Congratulations on being selected as the Friend of the Month</strong></p>
                <p>It's an honor</p>
                <p><strong>How did we become friends?</strong></p>
                <p>You were my neighbor in VCW 5Y at Georgetown and you lived with Diego and I lived with Risa and you lived next to me and you liked to do little bits between that door that was between our rooms. I would wake up to your alarm clock going off on snooze at least four times every morning.</p>
                <p><strong>We were doormates</strong></p>
                <p>Yeah there was a door</p>
                <p><strong>Would you say that we have a successful friendship?</strong></p>
                <p>I think we do. I think we have a lot of things in common and that the way we like interacting with people is pretty similar. We appreciate doing things outside or creating things. I think we both thrive in smaller group settings which allows our personalities to shine a bit more.</p>
                <p><strong>What is your ideal social outing?</strong></p>
                <p>My ideal social outing is a day-long activity that happens outside. I like doing things outside because I like having structured activities. I really struggle with things that are not structured, so a dinner party can be fun if I’m with people I feel comfortable with but if there are lots of people there that I don’t know very well, I tend not to open up as much. I have way more energy in the mornings and during the day. I’m a shell of who I actually am by 6pm. I need to be by myself after 6pm.</p>
                <p><strong>Describe your ideal friend</strong></p>
                <p>My ideal friend is someone who is able to laugh and make jokes at everything. I tend to take myself too seriously, so I need people in my life to take me out of that. I struggle with people who are overly outgoing and gregarious even though those are things I lack in my own personality. I have a hard time understanding where they come from. Obviously, I want friends that get along well with other people, but I do have a hard time maintaining friendships with people who are really really social creatures. I appreciate loyalty and people who don’t take it personally that I don’t reach out to them. I am so bad at reaching out to people. I have friends who I never talk to until I am back in Portland and I appreciate those friendships because they go back to when we were best friends in high school. I have a lot of guilt in trying to maintain relationships to the point where I will tend to isolate myself and then it becomes a cycle of wanting to maintain friendships, not having enough time to maintain them, feeling guilty, and so on. I appreciate people who know that I still want to be friends with them even though I might not reach out all the time.</p>
                <p><strong>Here in Durango, there are tons of people clamoring to befriend me. Could speak to those people and provide any tips on how to maintain a friendship with me.</strong></p>
                <p>It is really helpful if they have the same sense of humor as you. I understand your humor and I know not to take certain things seriously when you’re joking, but not everyone does. I think that you have a playful and childlike — not as in naive — but you have a very positive and excited view of the world and what you want to do on a daily basis. You need people who share that.</p>
                <p><strong>Describe a low from our friendship</strong></p>
                <p>Senior year when Brendan decided to go abroad, I ended up taking on a lot of the work for club climbing. There was a coup against you. I honestly could not care less, but I felt like I was put into a position where all the freshman and sophomores were recognizing that I was doing most of the work. At the same time, I wasn’t going to support a coup because it didn’t matter what my title was, I was going to do the work regardless. You were not at Georgetown a lot and I understood why. I was in the same position my freshman year. I didn’t want to legitimize the coup for the sake of our friendship. It was a weird situation.</p>
                <p><strong>Describe a high from our friendship</strong></p>
                <p>Sitting in the back of Helen’s car [after being pulled over late at night in rural West Virginia], bonding over how terrible Connor’s tuna mac n’ cheese was and how horrible that situation was. Looking back, I feel like that was the beginning of our friendship for life. We were on the same page. This is not OK but it is happening right now. Everyone else in the car was acting irrationally. Definitely a low moment overall but a moment that I will never forget.</p>
                <p><strong>Are there any media forms you wish were still common today</strong></p>
                <p>I am really sad that tumblr is dead. I was a big tumblr gal.</p>
                <p><strong>What did you like about it?</strong></p>
                <p>I liked it for its aesthetic values. You could create your own page using HTML and CSS and repost other peoples photos and graphic art. I liked designing my page and sharing art. It felt like creating a little art gallery.</p>
                <p><strong>What is your relationship with social media?</strong></p>
                <p>Well, there are a lot of new social medias that I am actively choosing not to join. BeReal is one. Apparently people besides my brother use it. He was the first person who told me about it. My brother is 18. He’s a true Gen-Zer. I deactivated my Facebook several years ago. One of my resolutions is to change my relationship with Instagram. I’ve noticed that in the evening when I’m on Instagram I get really anxious. It is so stimulating. My mind is races and I think about too many things at once. I like being more calm and less stressed.</p>
                <p><strong>What media do you currently enjoy?</strong></p>
                <p>I listen to a lot podcasts. I’m really into Hollywood podcasts right now. Podcasts about the economics behind the movie industry and the streaming wars. I’ve been reading more. Listening to music and doing activities. I’m not a big media person overall.</p>
                <p><strong>If you wanted to be social media famous, what do you think is the fastest route you could take to get there?</strong></p>
                <p>I think going on a reality TV show. Probably, Love is Blind. Have you heard of it?</p>
                <p><strong>I don’t know it. How does it work?</strong></p>
                <p>People speak to each other in pods. They have no idea what they look like and they propose to one another without knowing what they look like. They see each other after they are engaged… I’m really outing myself as a reality TV fan right now… There are only six couples that get engaged, so if you can get to be one of those couples and then create a victimization edit for yourself, you can get millions of Instagram followers. My strategy would be to pick one of the fuckbois that would never get married. They could “break your heart,” then you’d get a bunch of Instagram followers.</p>
                <p><strong>I'd like to finish this interview with some Either/Or questions</strong></p>
                <p><strong>A Toyota Yaris with a “Colorado Native” sticker OR a Macbook air with a “Don’t tread on me” sticker</strong></p>
                <p>The first one</p>
                <p><strong>Paul Mescal in a quilt jacket OR Phoebe Bridgers in chore coat?</strong></p>
                <p>Phoebe Bridgers</p>
                <p><strong>Speaking in a light southern accent while in Charleston or wearing a brown leather hat while walking around Santa Fe?</strong></p>
                <p>Did I buy the brown leather hat new? </p>
                <p><strong>You purchased a brown leather hat with little turquoise rock accents from a hat store in downtown Santa Fe.</strong></p>
                <p>In that case, the first one</p>
                <p><strong>Dry aged pork chop with a jalapeno corn puree OR Tri-tip bulgogi with a ginger lime risotto?</strong></p>
                <p>Tri-tip bulgogi</p>
                <p><strong>Kansas City, MO or Minneapolis, MN</strong></p>
                <p>Kansas City</p>
                <p><strong>Joining an eco-friendly cohousing community in Vermont OR joining the Equinox in Glendale, CA?</strong></p>
                <p>That’s so tough. These are dueling aspects of my personality. I’ll take the first one.</p>
                <p><strong>Going for a walk and calling your mom OR making a cup of tea and responding to your dad’s email?</strong></p>
                <p>The second one, calling my mom is stressful.</p>
                <p><strong>Wooden clogs or crocs?</strong></p>
                <p>Crocs, wooden clogs are so impractical</p>
                <p><strong>100 dollars worth of river stones or 100 dollars worth of candles?</strong></p>
                <p>The first one, I’m a big rock collector. Definitely a rock person.</p>
                <p><strong>Thanks for chatting!</strong></p>
