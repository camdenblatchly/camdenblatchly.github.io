        <p class="bw-bg">Here is a poem that Eliza shared with me. It is by Reverand Max Coots.
        </p>
        <p class="bw-bg poem">
            Let us give thanks for a bounty of people:<br><br>
            For children who are our second planting, and though they grow like weeds and the wind
            too soon blows them away, may they forgive us our cultivation and fondly remember
            where their roots are;<br><br>
            For generous friends with hearts and smiles as bright as their blossoms;<br><br>
            For feisty friends as tart as apples;<br><br>
            For continuous friends, who, like scallions and cucumbers, keep reminding us that we've
            had them;<br><br>
            For crotchety friends, as sour as rhubarb and as indestructible;<br><br>
            For handsome friends, who are as gorgeous as eggplants and as elegant as a row of corn,
            and the other, plain as potatoes and as good for you;<br><br>
            For funny friends, who are as silly as Brussels Sprouts and as amusing as Jerusalem
            Artichokes, and serious friends, as complex as cauliflowers and as intricate as onions;
            For friends as unpretentious as cabbages, as subtle as summer squash, as persistent as
            parsley, as delightful as dill, as endless as zucchini, and who, like parsnips, can be
            counted on to see you through the winter;<br><br>
            For old friends, nodding like sunflowers in the evening-time, and young friends coming
            on as fast as radishes;<br><br>
            For loving friends, who wind around us like tendrils and hold us, despite our blights,
            wilts and witherings;<br><br>
            And finally, for those friends now gone, like gardens past that have been harvested, and
            who fed us in their times that we might have life thereafter;<br><br>
            For all these we give thanks.

                    Now that streaming has turned into cable television, we can return to the wonderful world of free films on youtube.<br><br>
                    This month's free youtube film comes from director Matt Wolf and centers on the story of Arthur Russell, a talented avant-garde cellist and disco producer. A series of post-humous releases led to a resurgence of interest in his work.
                    <br><br>
                    The highlights of the film are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Russell’s midwestern parents</li>
                        <li>It’s depiction of NYC in the 70s and 80s</li>
                        <li>Tom Lee’s efforts to share Russell’s music</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Plus Arthur Russell's music is great! I like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK3Wl3LcOO8" target="_blank">Your Motion Says</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QY6nNFenaa0" target="blank">That's Us/Wild Combination</a>.

                <p>I am excited to feature Kesiah as the inaugural friend of the month. I called her up to congratulate her. The interview has been <strike>lightly</strike> heavily edited for brevity and clarity.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><strong>Congratulations on being selected as the Friend of the Month</strong></p>
                <p>It's a honor</p>
                <p><strong>How did we become friends?</strong></p>
                <p>You were my neighbor in VCW 5Y at Georgetown and you lived with Diego and I lived with Risa and you lived next to me and you liked to do little bits between that door that was between our rooms. I would wake up to your alarm clock going off on snooze at least four times every morning.</p>
                <p><strong>We were doormates</strong></p>
                <p>Yeah there was a door</p>
                <p><strong>Would you say that we have a successful friendship?</strong></p>
                <p>I think we do. I think we have a lot of things in common and that the way we like interacting with people is pretty similar. We appreciate doing things outside or creating things. I think we both thrive in smaller group settings which allows our personalities to shine a bit more.</p>
                <p><strong>What is your ideal social outing?</strong></p>
                <p>My ideal social outing is a day-long activity that happens outside. I like doing things outside because I like having structured activities. I really struggle with things that are not structured, so a dinner party can be fun if I’m with people I feel comfortable with but if there are lots of people there that I don’t know very well, I tend not to open up as much. I have way more energy in the mornings and during the day. I’m a shell of who I actually am by 6pm. I need to be by myself after 6pm.</p>
                <p>D<strong>escribe your ideal friend</strong></p>
                <p>My ideal friend is someone who is able to laugh and make jokes at everything. I tend to take myself too seriously, so I need people in my life to take me out of that. I struggle with people who are overly outgoing and gregarious even though those are things I lack in my own personality. I have a hard time understanding where they come from. Obviously, I want friends that get along well with other people, but I do have a hard time maintaining friendships with people who are really really social creatures. I appreciate loyalty and people who don’t take it personally that I don’t reach out to them. I am so bad at reaching out to people. I have friends who I never talk to until I am back in Portland and I appreciate those friendships because they go back to when we were best friends in high school. I have a lot of guilt in trying to maintain relationships to the point where I will tend to isolate myself and then it becomes a cycle of wanting to maintain friendships, not having enough time to maintain them, feeling guilty, and so on. I appreciate people who know that I still want to be friends with them even though I might not reach out all the time.</p>
                <p><strong>Here in Durango, there are tons of people clamoring to befriend me. Could speak to those people and provide any tips on how to maintain a friendship with me.</strong></p>
                <p>It is really helpful if they have the same sense of humor as you. I understand your humor and I know not to take certain things seriously when you’re joking, but not everyone does. I think that you have a playful and childlike — not as in naive — but you have a very positive and excited view of the world and what you want to do on a daily basis. You need people who share that.</p>
                <p><strong>Describe a low from our friendship</strong></p>
                <p>Senior year when Brendan decided to go abroad, I ended up taking on a lot of the work for club climbing. There was a coup against you. I honestly could not care less, but I felt like I was put into a position where all the freshman and sophomores were recognizing that I was doing most of the work. At the same time, I wasn’t going to support a coup because it didn’t matter what my title was, I was going to do the work regardless. You were not at Georgetown a lot and I understood why. I was in the same position my freshman year. I didn’t want to legitimize the coup for the sake of our friendship. It was a weird situation.</p>
                <p><strong>Describe a high from our friendship</strong></p>
                <p>Sitting in the back of Helen’s car [after being pulled over late a night in rural West Virginia], bonding over how terrible Connor’s tuna mac n’ cheese was and how horrible that situation was. Looking back, I feel like that was the beginning of our friendship for life. We were on the same page. This is not OK but it is happening right now. Everyone else in the car was acting irrationally. Definitely a low moment overall but a moment that I will never forget.</p>
                <p><strong>Are there any media forms you wish were still common today</strong></p>
                <p>I am really sad that tumblr is dead. I was a big tumblr gal.</p>
                <p><strong>What did you like about it?</strong></p>
                <p>I liked it for its aesthetic values. You could create your own page using HTML and CSS and repost other peoples photos and graphic art. I liked designing my page and sharing art. It felt like creating a little art gallery.</p>
                <p><strong>What is your relationship with social media?</strong></p>
                <p>Well, there are a lot of new social medias that I am actively choosing not to join. BeReal is one. Apparently people besides my brother use it. He was the first person who told me about it. My brother is 18. He’s a true Gen-Zer. I deactivated my Facebook several years ago. One of my resolutions is to change my relationship with Instagram. I’ve noticed that in the evening when I’m on Instagram I get really anxious. It is so stimulating. My mind is races and I think about too many things at once. I like being more calm and less stressed.</p>
                <p><strong>What media do you currently enjoy?</strong></p>
                <p>I listen to a lot podcasts. I’m really into Hollywood podcasts right now. Podcasts about the economics behind the movie industry and the streaming wars. I’ve been reading more. Listening to music and doing activities. I’m not a big media person overall.</p>
                <p><strong>If you wanted to be social media famous, what do you think is the fastest route you could take to get there?</strong></p>
                <p>I think going on a reality TV show. Probably, Love is Blind. Have you heard of it?</p>
                <p><strong>I don’t know it. How does it work?</strong></p>
                <p>People speak to each other in pods. They have no idea what they look like and they propose to one another without knowing what they look like. They see each other after they are engaged… I’m really outing myself as a reality TV fan right now… There are only six couples that get engaged, so if you can get to be one of those couples and then create a victimization edit for yourself, you can get millions of Instagram followers. My strategy would be to pick one of the fuckbois that would never get married. They could “break your heart,” then you’d get a bunch of Instagram followers.</p>
                <p><strong>We’re gonna do a rapid fire Either/Or section</strong></p>
                <p><strong>A Toyota Yaris with a “Colorado Native” sticker OR a Macbook air with a “Don’t tread on me” sticker</strong></p>
                <p>The first one</p>
                <p><strong>Paul Mescal in a quilt jacket OR Phoebe Bridgers in chore coat?</strong></p>
                <p>Phoebe Bridgers</p>
                <p><strong>Speaking in a light southern accent while in Charleston or wearing a brown leather hat while walking around Santa Fe?</strong></p>
                <p>Did I buy the brown leather hat new? </p>
                <p><strong>Yeah. You purchased a brown leather hat with little turquoise rock accents from a hat store in downtown Santa Fe.</strong></p>
                <p>In that case, the first one</p>
                <p><strong>Dry aged pork chop with a jalapeno corn puree OR Tri-tip bulgogi with a ginger lime risotto?</strong></p>
                <p>Tri-tip bulgogi</p>
                <p><strong>Kansas City, MO or Minneapolis, MN</strong></p>
                <p>Kansas City</p>
                <p><strong>Joining an eco-friendly co-housing community in Vermont OR joining the Equinox in Glendale CA?</strong></p>
                <p>That’s so tough. These are dueling aspects of my personality. I’ll take the first one.</p>
                <p><strong>Going for a walk and calling your mom OR making a cup of tea and responding to your dad’s email?</strong></p>
                <p>The second one, calling my mom is stressful.</p>
                <p><strong>Wooden clogs or crocs?</strong></p>
                <p>Crocs, wooden clogs are so impractical</p>
                <p><strong>100 dollars worth of river stones or 100 dollars worth of candles?</strong></p>
                <p>The first one, I’m a big rock collector. Definitely a rock person.</p>
                <p><strong>Thanks for chatting!</strong></p>
