      <p class="section-description ceo">
        In the fall of 1997, I was down and out.
        <br><br>
        I had lost my best racehorse to a broken leg at the Buffalo Raceway.
        <br><br>
        I was turned away by every VC in New York City.
        <br><br>
        So what did I do?
        <br><br>
        I stopped.
        <br><br>
        I paused.
        <br><br>
        I looked inward.
        <br><br>
        What did I see?
        <br><br>
        Three words:
        <br><br>
        CREATE THE FUTURE
        <br><br>
        That low was the start of a beautiful, unexpected, and incredibly profitable entrepreneurial journey.
        <br><br>
        I wouldn't have it any other way.
        <br><br>
        After last months successful launch of Camden's Social Media&#x2122;, I took a moment to do some deep reflection on my story and what the story of Camden's Social Media&#x2122; will be.
        <br><br>
        One thing was clear to me.
        <br><br>
        We need less division.
        <br><br>
        We need more hope.
        <br><br>
        Camden's Social Media&#x2122; is the solution.

        <h3>Friend of the Month</h3>
        <h3>Jake!</h3>
        <div class="interview">
          <img src="img/jake.JPG" style="width:100%;padding-bottom: 20px;">
          <p><strong>OK Jake, given that you&#x27;re four minutes late I&#x27;d like dive right into my series of questions. The first question I&#x27;d like you to answer as the friend of the month is: how did we become friends? </strong></p><p>This feels like more than where did we meet or how did we meet because becoming friends is later in the process after meeting. My first sight of a young Camden Blatchly was at Lakes of the Clouds in the summer of 2017. I walked in on a thru-hike of the AT and you were in there scrubbing away on some dishes in just the shortest shorts.</p><p><strong>I don&#x27;t know if this is real or if this is just a fake memory</strong></p><p>This is real! Those were the shortest shorts I’ve ever seen</p><p><strong>That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m known for</strong></p><p>But yeah, we met in the huts, and we had our first extended conversation the next year</p><p><strong>It was a long process</strong></p><p>We met in the huts, that’s the overarching theme here</p><p><strong>I want to see if we can agree on the same point in time when we became friends.. you are failing the test currently.</strong></p><p>I’m like 0 for 1 already. It was the summer of 2019 when we walked down from gala because we were supposed to be co-leadership at Carter, and that was our first extended conversation. I was like hey Camden, we were supposed to be becoming best friends yet here we are.</p><p><strong>Friendship denied</strong></p><p>Capital C coworkers</p><p><strong>That was definitely not a friendship conversation, that was a professional conversation.</strong></p><p>That was the first time we became coworkers, for sure</p><p><strong>Which we remain to this day</strong></p><p>I visited your hut a number of times, which was a blast because you were just so stellar at your job</p><p><strong>Flattery won’t work</strong></p><p>I don&#x27;t know where we became friends. It can’t be that we became friends when we started living together that same year. Can it?</p><p><strong>If I had to point to a specific moment, I think there was a slight shift when you came up and there were bugs in our barley</strong></p><p>Is this on the record?</p><p><strong>This is going to be published on the global internet</strong></p><p>I thought those bugs that we served guests was between you and I</p><p><strong>My website is very secure</strong></p><p>We may not have been friends, but I always enjoyed hanging out with you. Although maybe we were not capital F friends when we were capital C coworkers.</p><p><strong>I have a specific moment in mind when we both elected to do an activity together that was not due to our job. What was that activity? </strong></p><p>I can’t remember</p><p><strong>Going to the Fryeburg fair the first weekend we moved in</strong></p><p>Yup. The Thanksgiving sandwich.</p><p><strong>OK moving along after that rocky start. Could you describe a low from our friendship?</strong></p><p>The lows that initially come to mind are things like difficult backcountry situations, like on knife’s edge in Baxter. That doesn&#x27;t indicate conflict between you and I, just a low that you and I both experienced that, honestly, in hindsight became a high. I&#x27;m going to say that an ongoing low point is that I really want to hike Carrigain with you, but we haven’t yet.</p><p><strong>And I may never. I’m hoping to eventually haunt Carrigain.</strong></p><p>Your soul will circle right beneath the summit</p><p><strong>But never reach the summit</strong></p><p>So you’re saying we’re going to die with this conflict</p><p><strong>It can be resolved with a ritual using my remains, but I will leave that to you to figure out. It can be like Ben Campbell’s boots. Can you describe a high from our our friendship?</strong></p><p>I was really happy to learn that you were moving back North Conway and happy to have you back in North Conway. I&#x27;m not one to instigate social experiences, adventures, and outings. I tend to go for a solo runs with my headphones on and when I get into that pattern I stick to that pattern. You are the the one to instigate those social activities. Not just Carter notch club runs. Not just going on hikes with ourselves. But finding things like a run club and getting me involved there, trying to get frisbee back going, building community in a place that you just moved back to after many months away. You serve to me as a model of how to build community and make friends. It was great having you back in town for a bit, and I’m bummed to see you across the country, but you’re good at keeping up those relationships.</p><p><strong>By the way, have you gone to a run club event since I have left?</strong></p><p>I have not</p><p><strong>This is actually relevant because I’ve been thinking recently about how the format of a town or city influences our well-being. And in Jackson, it is much harder to be social because you’re far from things and you’re not running into as many people as you would in a more dense place.</strong></p><p>I was thinking about that too, mostly in the context of what makes gathering as friends so difficult. It is easy to say that in urban areas there are more things like bowling alleys or breweries to hang out in. Bowling alleys are always my go-to example but I don’t hang out in bowling alleys. </p><p>Anyways, it&#x27;s easy to say in urban areas that there are things like breweries and dog parks. Or in cities, there are music events and there are coffee shops you can work in. I think that&#x27;s all true and I think one thing that&#x27;s been sticking out to be more recently is — with new housemates, new friends, new partners — we all have different schedules because of the types of work that we have up here in the north country. It’s mostly seasonal, mostly rotating. Most of my friends don&#x27;t have the same 9 to 5 schedule as me. Most of my friends have many part-time jobs or have one job but it has days off on Thursday. To go to a late movie on Friday means that one person in the group is gonna be fucked for work the next day.</p><p><strong>There’s a double layer in the valley because not only is it harder to meet up because you are physically further away, but everyone’s schedules are also misaligned.</strong></p><p>Plus, most of the group activities here can also be solitary activities. Run club is great, but I love running alone. Huge ski groups are great, but I like nordic skiing alone too. Whereas in college, there&#x27;s like built-in friends with clubs and roommates. In the huts, you’re friends with the people you work with. After the huts and college, it’s been less of that. I’m also out of practice.</p><p><strong>College campuses are also built for connection because you’re constantly going through shared spaces. If you’re working remotely, you’re rarely going to shared spaces.</strong></p><p>Totally</p><p><strong>Moving on to a new topic, you&#x27;re in a new relationship. Would you like to comment on that publicly?</strong></p><p>Hi Ashley, I think you&#x27;re great </p><p><strong>And would you like to use this platform to comment on any past romantic relationships?</strong></p><p>I knew you would do something like this… no comment</p><p><strong>We’ll move to a different topic. What is your favorite aspect of corporate culture?</strong></p><p>My favorite aspect of corporate culture is slack emojis. Specifically the blob genre of slack emojis. Specifically the cat blob genre. There’s one that holds a little heart. We don’t get that kind of thing in seasonal work. In the huts, we don’t get emojis.</p><p><strong>Do you feel like there is a stigma with being a remote worker in the valley?</strong></p><p>I don&#x27;t know if stigma is the right word. Whatever it is, I certainly understand it. Disconnect, maybe. For any of my previous jobs in the valley, if someone asked me what I did, there&#x27;s an immediate follow-up question. You work at the bakery, do you know so-and-so? You work in the huts, which hut do you work at? More people than not speak mountains or local community institutions, not as many people speak Brooklyn startups. The conversation has a few more speed bumps to get started. I don’t perceive that as a stigma or a personal gripe. I think it’s just that the person has nothing to say about what I do.</p><p><strong>You are a known dog lover. Why?</strong></p><p>I grew up with dogs throughout my life which is so so fun. It’s always nice to have someone to come home to after school or after work. I&#x27;m always nice to have someone to flop down next to…</p><p>Y<strong>ou’re saying the word “someone” to describe a dog</strong></p><p>You know Cam, there’s an article I read recently about loneliness and the effects on the brain, and one sign of a lonely person was that they over-anthropomorphize objects and animals.</p><p><strong>That’s so depressing</strong></p><p>But anyways, I love dogs. Dogs are great. The unconditional love that dogs show is wonderful. Dogs provide structure and activity to life. It’s really fun to meet people who have dogs, and it’s fun to meet people when there is a dog present.</p><p><strong>I noticed you were on a rival social media. Cough.. cough… Instagram</strong></p><p>Don&#x27;t like and subscribe</p><p><strong>Unfollow and delete please. Anyways, I noticed that in photos of you with dogs, you make the same face in every photo when there&#x27;s a dog near you. Could you describe that face and why you make that face?</strong></p><p>For sure. You know, as a fellow man in society, we are taught not to express emotions. And from a very young age, it&#x27;s hard for us to feel comfortable smiling, laughing, and even crying. And especially crying is very hard for us strong men in society, but I can’t help but sob when I see a dog.</p><p><strong>So that’s why you are streaming tears in every photo with a dog on Instagram</strong></p><p>Going back to your earlier question about why I love dogs, it’s because they allow me to express unbridled emotion in a way that society has oppressed me such that I may not.</p><p><strong>Thank you for sharing that</strong></p><p>I actually don’t know the face you’re mentioning, could you describe it?</p><p><strong>Yeah, it&#x27;s like a closed mouth smile</strong></p><p>It’s like a see what I got smile</p><p><strong>It’s a contentedness. It’s the face that you would make if you were cupping a mug of tea with two hands and you were bringing it up to your mouth and right before you take your first sip you might do a little closed mouth smile.</strong></p><p>Got it</p><p><strong>Who is your current favorite roommate. Nell or Jake?</strong></p><p>Yes</p><p><strong>Discuss the pros and cons of your two roommates. Neither read Camden’s Social Media so feel free to be candid.</strong></p><p>I’ll start with the cons. When Jesse Carlson moved out Jake moved in. It has made it such that the majority of the people in our house are named Jake. That’s really hard.</p><p>The pros of my roommates are far more numerous. They&#x27;re wonderful people with great personalities, who are great listeners, who are really easy to live with and even more fun to hang out with. Things like hiking and skiing with them are fun and I feel uncomfortable with the question.</p><p><strong>I was wondering if you could do a fit check and tell me everything that you&#x27;re currently wearing</strong></p><p>Sure. So this top that I have on right now is a long sleeve, hooded merino wool mid-layer. I don&#x27;t know the brand, but I got it out in Utah when I worked for a company called Evoke. This thing has been with me for a while. Love it. Probably my favorite top.</p><p>Moving on, I got on some REI Carhartt knock-offs. They are like thick, copper-colored canvas pants with abundant pockets. I will say that the pockets break mad easily, but the pants are wicked comfortable and they’ve got that copper tone so they work with every color. Just awesome.</p><p>And I got on some darn tough socks and the last time I did a darn tough sock exchange I experimented with the military line of socks, which I was a little skeptical about since I didn&#x27;t need…</p><p><strong>Every pair, five bucks goes straight to a Marine</strong></p><p>I love the drone edition</p><p><strong>Sponsor a drone today with darn tough socks</strong></p><p>Yeah, these things are sick, they’re wicked thick and are so comfortable.</p><p>I also have an old belt on that I probably stole from my brothers, and I have a scrunchie for my hair.</p><p><strong>Are you wearing a T-shirt?</strong></p><p>No</p><p><strong>And your underwear, is it Calvin Klein, Hanes? </strong></p><p>I’m not wearing any underwear</p><p><strong>In thick canvas pants? That’s crazy, that’s the worst pant to do that. But thanks for sharing.</strong></p><p>This social media finally got risque</p><p><strong>Finally, a scoop.</strong></p><p><strong>I read recently that wearing an outfit is like writing a sentence. It says this is what I’m doing today, this is what the weather is, these are some of my beliefs. What is the sentence your outfit is currently saying?</strong></p><p>I’m ready to nap and I’m also ready to shovel snow</p><p><strong>Recently, you had to purchase clothes to attend a convening of your company in Brooklyn</strong></p><p>Correct</p><p><strong>What were you trying to say with the outfit you selected? Describe that sentence. And, for context, also describe the outfit.</strong></p><p>Sure sure sure. What I was trying to say was I belong here. I&#x27;m a part of this group.</p><p><strong>I am not other.</strong></p><p>Yes. Did I say that successfully? I was overdressed, for sure. The outfit I was looking for was something more business casual than these essentially pajamas that I’m wearing right now.</p><p><strong>For context, Jake wears what he is currently wearing every day.</strong></p><p>Yup. And if it were warmer I would be wearing a swimsuit instead of these pants.</p><p><strong>A swimsuit with a graphic design</strong></p><p>Yes, which is not necessarily Brooklyn-chic</p><p><strong>So the outfit you curated was like what someone living in northern New Hampshire thinks people in Brooklyn dress like.</strong></p><p>That&#x27;s a good way to put it. </p><p>I do like the idea that an outfit is a sentence. I was headed to my grandma&#x27;s funeral this past week, and I ended up laying out a couple different outfits on the floor that I could wear to the funeral. None of them felt sufficient. To put them in sentence, it would say “I don&#x27;t respect you. I don&#x27;t love you, grandma.” So I put those clothes away and I went to the store before my flight to get some new clothes. Cause, yeah, I like the idea that clothes send a message. I think that’s true.</p><p>In the past few years, that message has been expressing myself in a really, flamboyant, carefree, excitable way, while also feeling loose, and athletic, and body positive. And now I’m going back out into the world and working for a company in Brooklyn, and I can’t express what I’m now feeling in pajama tops and swimsuits. So I got some button downs, chinos, and casual shoes that aren’t Hokas or Crocs, which is new to me. And then last week, I got a suit. Like a black on white suit, which is new and feels very foreign, but I think it says the right sentence.</p><p><strong>There is a large wilderness therapy company in Durango. You used to work in wilderness therapy. Could you describe the kind of people that work in wilderness therapy?</strong></p><p>There&#x27;s a couple of different groups of people that work in wilderness therapy. One is I graduated with a psych degree, and I don&#x27;t have the brain power, money or energy to go to grad school to get a PhD. I want to help people and I want to do that now. I don&#x27;t want to do that with any more education. That was me.</p><p>Two is I just jumped off the AT and I want to work in the wilderness. I have all the answers to life.</p><p>Three is I actually have my PhD and I&#x27;m looking to expand into different realms of practice.</p><p>There are people who have lived the experience of wilderness therapy their entire life and decide to get paid for it. There was one guy I remember distinctly. His name, as far as I know, is Red Hawk. He didn&#x27;t have nerves in his hand because he would just reach into the fire and grab logs to move them. He spent his free time whittling spoons and would camp during his time off. </p><p>There are people who went through wilderness therapy and return to help other people through their experience.</p><p>Generally, chillers. I would say people who are fun to work with for a week at a time. Fun to live with for the most part… if you have to.</p><p><strong>Would you like to describe your experience living with other people working in wilderness therapy?</strong></p><p>It was my first living situation out of college, so it was both the best and worst experience. It was generally accepted as normal that three goats were our lawnmowers. A typical Friday night might look like everybody drunk, and somebody telling a story while waiving a hand gun or shotgun around the room. </p><p><strong>It’s so not funny but..</strong></p><p>It’s so vivid for me still. You can’t have enough storage when you live with people in wilderness therapy because everyone has so much outdoor gear. People cook really well. There&#x27;s always fun to be had. The community is really strong. While it might be a little bit more chaotic than a more traditional household, it&#x27;s also a really warm and compassionate place that I look back on very fondly.</p><p><strong>You are a known beat maker. What types of music have you been making recently?</strong></p><p>I&#x27;ve discovered recently that a lot of music that I like to listen to is called float house. It&#x27;s kind of like you&#x27;re grooving lightly, but there&#x27;s no drop. It’s a long term groove. Really light snares, really light high hats. Very ethereal. It’s good work music, and it’s also good running music. I like listening to it, and I also like making it because it&#x27;s more formulaic, and the hardware and software I use to make music lends itself to things that can be slightly organic but a little bit more formulaic. </p>

        <p class="text-section">
          In addition to making friendships, Jake also makes beats. I really like <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mcslambley/beef?utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing" target="_blank">this song</a> he made out of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIi74DKWErA&ab_channel=TinoCardasis">this video of a professor saying beef 125 times in one lecture</a>.
          <br><br>
          He also makes more normal things like this collection of songs, where the structure of each song is the same: 4 samples, 4 interpolations of each sample, all coming together to make 4 beats in a single song... for 10 songs. 
          <br><br>
          Jake gave the following challenge: "My challenge to your readers is this: Whoever can accurately identify the most samples in this album will receive a $50 gift card (Mom & Pop shop of their choice or Amazon) from me."  Check it out below:

        <h3>How to make an outdoor media youtube film</h3>
        <p class="text-section">
          Your film should be 5-14 minutes long.
          <br><br>
          It should share the story of a highly-trained athlete completing an arduous mountain challenge. The highly-trained athlete should be a man and, ideally, he should struggle with the risk of his outdoor pursuits and the impact his death could have on his wife and four year-old son, ideally named Cedar, Forrest, or Wren. His wife or girlfriend should confess that she wishes he would stop doing these risky mountain pursuits, but then acknowledge that he just wouldn’t be himself otherwise.
          <br><br>
          Your film should be serious. When asked why he does what he does, the athlete should say something generic about the beauty in not knowing if a challenge is possible. Throughout the film, the athlete should constantly express his excitement about the activity in a monotone voice. The soundtrack should be tense and dramatic. The athlete should never smile or make a joke about the absurdity of the contrived challenge he is pursuing.
          <br><br>
          Or your film should be irreverent and fun! The athletes should all wear tutus and retro 80s clothing. The men should have mustaches that they refer to as their “adventurestache.” They should do a big outdoor adventure wearing jorts and then celebrate with a beer in the parking lot afterwards. They should refer to their big outdoor adventure as a <em>sufferfest</em>.
          <br><br>
          Or your film should have a <em>purpose</em>. The athlete should do a mountain challenge to bring awareness to an issue. Awareness will solve the issue. The athlete should have an amazing experience doing the challenge, and, afterwards, reflect on the power of community and the importance of protecting wild places.
          <br><br>
          Or your film should highlight a role model. It should share the story of a simple person who has dedicated their life to conservation. The film should be filled with beautiful shots of this hero procuring plant samples from high on a cliffside, even though the vast majority of the hero’s days are spent working at a computer in an office. The film should make us feel bad about the meaninglessness of our jobs and feel great about the brand that sponsored the video.
          <br><br>
          Congrats, you've now made an outdoor media youtube film. Don't forget to break it into clips for TikTok, promote it aggressively on Instagram, and premier it at your main sponsor's retail location in New York.
