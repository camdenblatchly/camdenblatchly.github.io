        <p>Hello. Thanks for tuning in to my social media! I just want to be liked!!</p>
        <p>Some highlights from the last month or so include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>CORI’s biannual all-staff retreat! This year, we headed to Staunton in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, home to the Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library (boo) but also home to one of the finest main streets I’ve yet seen (yay). While there, we got to hear from the folks running the Shenandoah Community Capital Fund (SCCF), our community partner in Staunton, who are working to counteract a decades-long decline in manufacturing by investing in entrepreneurs local to the Shenandoah region. Optimism!</li>
            <div class="feature-img">
                <img src="img/staunton.jpg" class="u-max-full-width">
                <p>(Looking over downtown Staunton from the campus of Mary Baldwin University)</p>
            </div>
            <li>Another March highlight was attending a Charlotte Checkers game (they lost) and a Charlotte Urbanists walking tour while visiting Delaney on my way to and from Staunton. Charlotte has responded to its housing shortage by issuing housing permits at much higher rates than other comparable cities (see more below). The amount of new building is astounding (especially in comparison with Boston), but <a href="https://www.sightline.org/2017/09/21/yes-you-can-build-your-way-to-affordable-housing/" target="_blank">the city remains more affordable as a result</a>. Hearing from local planners on the walking tour grounded the difficult trade-offs we have to make in order to ensure cities remain affordable. Also, the Bojangles Coliseum may be my favorite sporting venue.</li>
            <div class="feature-img">
                <img src="img/urbanist.jpg" class="u-max-full-width">
                <p>(Parking requirements make developments more expensive. Here's a bad photo I took of an apartment building that will have no parking, allowing the units to be rented at lower rates. It also has this neat pedestrian corridor with spaces for 'micro-retail.')</p>
            </div>
            <li>Two weekends ago marked the end of my first season volunteering for the Adaptive Sports Association in Durango. I started volunteering for ASA the first weekend I moved to Durango, and I’m not sure how I will spend my weekends now that the winter season has come to a close (I hope to spend more time on my social media, slowly turning the tide towards profitability). I did close the season by "winning" the Taking the Lead&#x2122; award for picking up the fine art of tethering. Other than my 5th place, 7th draw, Class C squash trophy, this award may be my finest to date (and YES every volunteer got an award but mine was more prestigious and elite than all the others OK!).</li>

            </div>
            <li>Throughout March, I also maximally enjoyed listening to Emilia and Meredith’s radio show every Sunday morning at 8am M.T. on WOZQ 91.9. Check it out! It's excellent and I'm not just saying that because they cater exclusively to my musical preferences.</li>
        </ul>
        Here are some more things I want to share. <em>Note: Please share things with me.</em> I'm begging. If I'm going to turn this business towards profitability, I will need your content to get more clicks which I can then monetize via banner ads. Thanks a bunch.</p>

                    Have you ever wondered why so many talented musical artists are secretly Canadian? I too have wondered about this phenomenon. Luckily, I came across this wonderful documentary on the anglophone music scene in Montreal which at least provides some context. Film highlight: A pre-Salad Days Mac Demarco gets a little feature.

                <p class="text-section">After attending the Charlotte Urbanists walking tour, my curiosity was further piqued by <a href="https://blogs.hightoweradvisors.com/las-vegas/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2023/03/image-36.png" target="_blank">this graphic</a> which compares housing permits per capita across major metropolitan areas. I was curious to see how these metrics compared at the county level, so I recreated the graphic for a subset of counties I was interested in.</p>
                <p class="text-section">As you can see in the chart above, housing permits per capita in Mecklenburg County (home to Charlotte) far outpace the permits per capita in San Francisco County and Suffolk County (home to Boston).</p>
                <p class="text-section">It's also interesting to note that counties with tourism-based economies (La Plata, Carroll, and Grafton) still aren't issuing as many housing permits as they were prior to the great recession.</p>
                <p class="text-section">If you're curious about a particular county, you can download the <a href="https://github.com/camdenblatchly/County-Building-Permits/blob/main/data/building_permits_cty_2000_2019.csv" target="_blank">full dataset I created here</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-section">And if you're curious to learn more about the causes of and solutions to housing shortages, I enjoyed <a href="https://thetownsman.org/portlands-great-housing-shortage-the-facts/" target="_blank">this piece</a> by the Portland Townsman.</p>

                <div class="feature-img">

                <p class="text-section">Upon moving to England in the summer of 2007, I quickly began the process of assimilation. I learned the rules of cricket, rugby, and field hockey. I incorporated key pieces of slang (<em>chav</em>, <em>cracking</em>, <em>mate</em>) into my vocabulary, and, most importantly, I ditched my cargo pants and t-shirts for an itchy wool blazer and school tie that I wore to class every day.</p>
                <p class="text-section">
                    Thus began my relationship with ‘preppy’ clothing, a realm of style so rife with connotations and cultural associations that seven episodes are needed to fully explore its origins and legacy in Avery Trufelman’s excellent podcast <a href="https://articlesofinterest.substack.com/p/american-ivy-chapter-1" target="_blank">American Ivy</a>. Over the course of the series, Trufelman traces how a style originating on ivy league campuses was alternately championed by Japanese teenagers, civil rights activists, Jewish entrepreneurs, and Brooklyn rappers.
                </p>
                <p class="text-section">
                    While ivy style has become the default business casual uniform, it wasn't always associated with formality; rather, ivy style rose to prominence because it was a casual and comfortable alternative to the wool suits that were the male uniform of the time.</p>
                <p class="text-section">
                    This contrast between current and past notions of formality is why I love photos from the late 20th century. Outfits that appear prim to our modern eye were once as unceremonious as a tracksuit.</p>
                <p class="text-section">I especially adore old photos of hut croos. While their clothing choices were (presumably) driven by practicality, when I see old photos of croo hiking in fisherman sweaters and khaki shorts, I can’t help but find their outfits wonderfully decorous. In this era of rampant consumerism, these photos are a reminder that before we had Gore-Tex, Spandex, and other "technical" garments, people still managed to hike and live in the mountains. They looked great doing so too. Here are some of my favorites.</p>
